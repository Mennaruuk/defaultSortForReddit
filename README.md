# defaultSortForReddit
Simple firefox extension to automatically redirect from https://www.reddit.com/?feed=home to https://www.reddit.com/new/?feed=home, effectively default sorting to "new" on the home page. 

This extension also allows you to change which option you want the default sort to be!
